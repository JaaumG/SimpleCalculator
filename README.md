# Simple Calculator

This is a project base on Windows 10/11 calculator, made on JavaFx this calculator can do simple but useful operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, and power.
Because of the way variable and operation works on java it happens to be not precise as windows calculator is, you can test your self by adding 0.2 and 0.1 on java or other programming language, trust me, it wont be exactly 0.3.
